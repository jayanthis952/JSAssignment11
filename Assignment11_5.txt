    Output: The third Largest element is 13
    
    Explanation: The corrected code finds the third largest element in the given array using three loops. In the first loop, it finds the largest element and stores it in the variable first. In the second loop, it finds the second largest element that is smaller than first and stores it in the variable second. In the third loop, it finds the third largest element that is smaller than second and stores it in the variable third. Finally, it prints the value of third.
